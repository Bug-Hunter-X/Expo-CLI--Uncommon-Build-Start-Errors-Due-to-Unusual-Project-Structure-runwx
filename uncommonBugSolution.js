The solution depends on the specific nature of the "uncommon" error.  Here are some approaches:

**1. Check File Structure:** Ensure that your project files are structured according to Expo's conventions.  Unusual or deeply nested directory structures can confuse the build process.

**2. Review Dependencies:** Review your `package.json` and ensure all dependencies are compatible with Expo and each other.  Conflicts or outdated packages are frequent sources of cryptic errors.

**3. Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild can resolve temporary build issues. Try:
    * `expo prebuild --clean`
    * `expo start`

**4. Examine Error Messages:** While Expo's error messages can be vague, carefully examine the entire error stack trace for clues.  Look for file paths or module names that are unexpected or misplaced.

**5. Simplify the Project:** If the error is persistent, try creating a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the issue. This will help in diagnosing the root cause more effectively.

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's say a missing module was the cause:

```javascript
//uncommonBug.js (Problematic)
import someModule from '../unexpected/path/to/module';
```

```javascript
// uncommonBugSolution.js (Corrected)
import someModule from 'some-module'; // Correct path or installation
```
